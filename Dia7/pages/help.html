        <h1>🆘 How to Play – Game Guide</h1>
      
        <h2>🎮 Starting the Game</h2>
        <p>Click the <strong>"Start"</strong> button on the homepage to begin your match.</p>
      
        <h2>🂠 The Cards</h2>
        <p>At the start of each round, <strong>two hidden cards</strong> will appear on screen (one for each player).</p>
        <p>You <strong>won’t see their values</strong> until you choose to reveal them.</p>
      
        <h2>🔁 Changing Your Card</h2>
        <p>Next to each card, there’s a <strong>"Change Card"</strong> button.</p>
        <p>Click it to <strong>swap your card</strong> as many times as you want before revealing.</p>
        <p>You can change your card multiple times or keep the one you have.</p>
      
        <h2>🎴 Winning Cards</h2>
        <p>After each round, the cards that each player wins will be <strong>collected and shown on the side</strong>,</p>
        <p>between the "Change Card" button and the hidden card section.</p>
        <p>These cards are saved until the end to decide the winner!</p>
      
        <h2>👁️ Revealing the Cards</h2>
        <p>Once both players are ready, click the <strong>"Show Cards"</strong> button.</p>
        <p>Both cards will be <strong>flipped face-up</strong>, revealing their true values.</p>
      
        <h2>🏆 Who Wins the Round?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The player with the <strong>higher card</strong> wins the round and takes <strong>both cards</strong>.</li>
          <li>Card values:
            <ul>
              <li>🃏 <strong>J, Q, K</strong> = 10 points</li>
              <li>🅰️ <strong>A (Ace)</strong> = 11 points</li>
              <li>🔢 Number cards (2–10) = their face value</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>🤝 If both players have cards with the <strong>same value</strong> (e.g. a <strong>J</strong> and a <strong>K</strong>, both worth 10), it's a <strong>tie</strong> and <strong>no one gets the cards</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>🔄 New Rounds</h2>
        <p>After revealing the cards, click the <strong>"Next Round"</strong> button to continue.</p>
        <p>⚠️ If you don’t click "Next Round", the screen will stay the same — the game won’t move on until you decide to.</p>
      
        <h2>👑 How to Win the Game</h2>
        <p>When the deck runs out, the player with the <strong>most collected cards</strong> is the <strong>winner</strong>! 🎉</p>
      
        <h2>❌ Exiting the Game</h2>
        <p>To leave the game at any time, click the <strong>"X"</strong> button in the top-left corner.</p>
